    <p>Any ways, I'm learning to code and made this meme page to commemorate my first site! My goals include:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Learn to code that will support my journey becoming an UX/UI Designer</li>
      <li>Work at a video game company to one day contribute in bettering the experience</li>
      <li>Support coders, streamers, and other folks, espeically queer and trans Black and Indigenous People of Color from low-income backgrounds, interested in tech and how to navigate the space</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Learn more about me and internet shenanigans: <a href="https://linktr.ee/reytoon" target="_blank">Linktree (There is nothing fishy - I promise!)</a></p>
    <p>Also, please accept my apologies and listen to some words of affirmation by yours truly:</p>
